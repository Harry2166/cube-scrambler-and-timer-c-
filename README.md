# cube-scrambler-and-timer-c-
A Rubikâ€™s Cube scrambler and timer made in C++.

For those without experience in using or solving a Rubik's Cube, refer to the following link: https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/notation/

This is similar to the following repository: https://github.com/Harry2166/Cube-Scrambler-and-Timer.

It has the same functions as the repository above, all just written in C++ code.

*I'm not that well-versed in writing in C++ code but this was a nice change of pace from doing just Python code*
